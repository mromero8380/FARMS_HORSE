# FARMS_HORSE

Final Project for CS3550 - Advanced Database. We were hired by an imaginery company that wanted us to create a database for their cleaning side 
of a hotel business. We created scripts to test out our data as well as demonstrate scenarios that may occurr. This was done with the efforts of
Natalie Mueller and Marcell Romero.
